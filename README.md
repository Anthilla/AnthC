Thanks @EstebanCorredor. Thanks for the #passionate hard work, costructive and positive discussions, difficult moment and the time spent on the #project, and the given patience and support. Thanks for respecting the requirements and extending the possibilities.

After a lot of work we are proud to present the Model 1, Release 1 of Anthilla 's #GeneralPurpose #Iot #IIot #Controller "#AnthillaController" or #AnthC made to be a #baseline brick to build real #industrial40 or for #smart projects. This is NOT designed to be a devboard but a finite element. So #notadevboard but a #product.

*Are you serious?*

Yes, anyone can collaborate as #opensource #oshw project, we want collaborate to collate and consider all suggested checklist to apply any changes to permit the compatibility with a large set of certifications.

Some other features
- all informations are on board
- extended range temperature
- independent 5/3.3v power section from 12/24v section. If you don't need 12/24v you can power only the 5/3.3v section.
- no buttons
- Esp32 Wroom/Wrover compatibility
