## Description

The Anthilla Controller Board is a flexible controller for IoT projects. It can be easily adapted for different needs. The board has the Rasperry-pi form factor to fast the integration.

## Features

- Extended range temperature
- Input power: 7V - 28V. The board can be powered by just powering 5V area.
- 4 Digital inputs
- 6 Open collector outputs
- 4 Analog inputs (16 bit ADC) or 4-20mA inputs switchable (multiplexed)
- RS485 communication
- Real time clock
- Rechargeable LiPo battery
- I2C and SPI communication
- USB-C port

## Last changes

The version M2-R4 has the following differences

- The PCB stackup is Signal + Power / GND / GND / Signal + Power
- Battery control circuit: replaced the bipolar transistor by a MOSFET

## Roadmap

The version M2-R3 is stable. The next steps are the following:

- Manufacture and test the M2-R4
- Perform EMC tests
- Generate the CE certificate
- Write the documentation for the final user
- Develop a base Firmware
